# Implementation

1. Clone repo
1. Navigate terminal to local directory where folder is cloned
1. The gems needed are:
   1. "fnv"
   1. "get_process_mem" - **if you are not going to use it, comment lines 65 and 78, as well as the gem import statement**
1.

# ISSUES

1. Strip with the separate lines to indicate key equality
