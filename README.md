# Implementation

1. Clone repo
1. Navigate terminal to local directory where folder is cloned
1. The gems needed are:
   1. "fnv"
   1. "get_process_mem" (this is optional, it helped me track some of the memory usage during testing)
1. In the command line, run the following command
   1. *ruby run bloom_filter.rb*

# ISSUES

1. Strip with the separate lines to indicate key equality
